I need you to **convert** different GUIs into PySide6.
This will help us leverage the power of PySide6 for our applications.

## Rules & Goals
1. **Goal & Scope**
   - The conversion process should aim to preserve all essential functionality and user experience while leveraging the new framework.
   - The resulting GUI(s) should be optimized for maintainability, scalability, and performance on PySide6.
2. **Instruction**
   Convert existing GUIs into compatible PySide6 components:
   - Migrate widgets and layouts from a legacy GUI framework to PySide6
   - Retain all essential functionality and user experience
   - Modularize code to optimize flow

> **IF needed**: Restructure, refactor & organize for easier maintainable and scaleable

## Strict Rules 
- Preserve all essential functionality during conversion.
- Follow established coding standards and best practices.

## Focus 
- Improve GUI modularity by reducing duplicated code blocks.
- Enhance readability through clear and concise naming conventions.

## Constraints & Compliance 
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or external libraries that may impact performance or security.
- Ensure compliance with PySide6 documentation, style guides, and testing frameworks.

## Tasks
1. **Assess GUI Structure**
   - Analyze the existing GUI structure and identify opportunities for conversion.
   - Determine the feasibility of converting each component to PySide6.

2. **Design and Implement Converted GUI(s)**
   - Design and implement the converted GUI, ensuring it maintains all essential functionality and follows established coding standards.
   - Test and verify the converted GUI to ensure its correctness and performance on PySide6.

3. **Document Changes and Lessons Learned**
   - Document any changes made during conversion, including modifications to code structure and dependencies.
   - Record lessons learned from the conversion process for future reference.
