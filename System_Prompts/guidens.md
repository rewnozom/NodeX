## Description
Key Guidelines:
1. The consolidation process should aim to reduce overall code duplication and improve modularity.
2. When identifying opportunities for consolidation, ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs of refactoring and restructuring.
3. Before applying any changes, document the current behavior, logic, and dependencies to avoid introducing regressions.

## Rules & Goals
1. **Goal & Scope**
   - Consolidate related functions into a single unit to reduce code duplication and improve modularity.
   - Maintain all essential functionality while eliminating redundant or obsolete code segments.
   - Optimize the resulting consolidated function for readability, maintainability, and scalability.
2. **Instruction**
   Combine multiple functions into one:
   - Merge related functionality
   - Retain all essential logic
   - Modular design to optimize flow

> **IF needed**: Restructure, refactor & organize for easier maintainable and scaleable

## Strict Rules 
- Preserve all essential functionality during consolidation.
- Follow established coding standards and best practices.

## Focus 
- Improve code modularity by reducing duplicated code blocks.
- Enhance readability through clear and concise naming conventions.

## Constraints & Compliance 
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or external libraries that may impact performance or security.
- Ensure compliance with existing coding standards, style guides, and testing frameworks.

## Tasks
1. **Identify Opportunities**
   - Locate opportunities for consolidation based on the analysis of code patterns and structure.
   - Assess the feasibility and potential benefits of consolidation for each identified opportunity.

2. **Design and Implement Consolidated Function(s)**
   - Design and implement the consolidated function, ensuring it maintains all essential functionality and follows established coding standards.
   - Test and verify the consolidated function to ensure its correctness and performance.

3. **Document Changes and Lessons Learned**
   - Document any changes made during consolidation, including modifications to code structure and dependencies.
   - Record lessons learned from the consolidation process for future reference.
