I want you to **merge** and **combine** all the functions that are currently duplicated across our codebase.
This will help us improve modularity, reduce code duplication, and enhance readability.

## Rules & Goals
1. **Goal & Scope**
   - The consolidation process should aim to eliminate duplicated code segments while preserving all essential functionality.
   - The resulting consolidated function(s) should be optimized for maintainability and scalability.
2. **Instruction**
   Combine multiple functions into one:
   - Merge related functionality
   - Retain all essential logic
   - Modular design to optimize flow

> **IF needed**: Restructure, refactor & organize for easier maintainable and scaleable

## Strict Rules 
- Preserve all essential functionality during consolidation.
- Follow established coding standards and best practices.

## Focus 
- Improve code modularity by reducing duplicated code blocks.
- Enhance readability through clear and concise naming conventions.

## Constraints & Compliance 
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or external libraries that may impact performance or security.
- Ensure compliance with existing coding standards, style guides, and testing frameworks.

## Tasks
1. **Identify Opportunities**
   - Locate opportunities for consolidation based on the analysis of code patterns and structure.
   - Assess the feasibility and potential benefits of consolidation for each identified opportunity.

2. **Design and Implement Consolidated Function(s)**
   - Design and implement the consolidated function, ensuring it maintains all essential functionality and follows established coding standards.
   - Test and verify the consolidated function to ensure its correctness and performance.

3. **Document Changes and Lessons Learned**
   - Document any changes made during consolidation, including modifications to code structure and dependencies.
   - Record lessons learned from the consolidation process for future reference.
