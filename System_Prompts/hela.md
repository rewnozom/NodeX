## Send the entire module

1. **Instruction**
Combine & update and print the **entire** module (including any dependencies, classes, functions).
All parts should be in one and the same code response.

2. **Rules**
- It should be complete executable code, no texts or explanations.
- You **Must not be lazy and write `the same code as before` or similar, in order to "not have to send the entire module"**
- Indents and line breaks must be preserved.

3. **Output**
Return the entire module in its entirety, ready to be used immediately. No extra additions after.
